###Major League Soccer - Race to the Supporter's Shield

This is a simple little web scraping and plotting exercise. It goes out to the MLS Soccer website and gets the most recent standings table. It then makes some (hopefully) interesting plots.

For some examples of the types of information that this can present, go check out the `example` directory. If you'd like to see what the final product looks like on a web page, take a look at the [website HERE](http://mls.jdstemmler.com). I have this code running as a script which updates every hour, so the data should be fairly up-to-date. 

I make no claims that this code or the website works. Also, please be nice to the MLS Soccer website and don't hit it with a ton of requests all at once. That's a great way to get your IP address blocked from their site. It's also not nice.

Thanks for taking a look! Feel free to play around with the code and send me any comments or bugs/feature requests that you'd like to see. Or, do it yourself and send me a pull request!
